Any dispute arising between you and 4FRNT Education LLC must be resolved through binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association instead of in court. This agreement waives both parties' rights to a jury trial or participation in class actions. Exceptions exist for individuals bringing claims in small claims court, or for bringing issues to the attention of government agencies. Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis only; no consolidation or joining of claims and no group, representative, or class proceedings. We commit to attempting to informally resolve disputes via email before serving a formal Notice of Dispute to initiate arbitration. The arbitration process will follow the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, with this Arbitration Agreement governing whenever its terms conflict with the AAA Rules. We will cover all arbitration costs if forcing you to pay would make arbitration prohibitively expensive. 

Arbitrators can award all the same remedies to individuals as courts, and their decisions are enforceable but may be appealed on limited grounds. Hearings will occur at reasonably convenient locations, factoring in travel limitations. You may reject changes made to this section within 30 days of modifications. If any part is found invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Terms will remain in force. In summary, this agreement establishes binding individual arbitration as the dispute resolution process fo r most issues between 4FRNT Education LLC and users, waiving court trials and class wide claims in favor of a private arbitrator while still allowing individuals to pursue small claims cases or bring concerns to regulators. 

 

      </p>
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '20px', marginTop: '30px' }}> Governing Law  </h2>
      <p>

respect to non-arbitrated disputes, you and 4FRNT Education LLC consent to the jurisdiction of

Changes & Enforceability <br></br>

parties intend for the court to give effect to intent shown by the term, with other provisions 

remaining in full force. <br></br>

barred. Printed versions carry the same legal authority for proceedings as electronic.

law. Individual sections can be severed if invalid without impairing other terms. Users consent to 

Florida courts and arbitration rules, with a one-year limit to bring claims. Additional 

restrictions may cover third party tools.  <br></br>
